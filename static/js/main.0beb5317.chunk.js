After coming across Google's MusicLM, I was inspired to create my own deep learning powered software synthesizer.",synthlm2:'My goal with this project is to create the first text-to-sample synthesizer meant for music production. Rather than generating entire songs like MusicLM and similar projects, my focus is on generating short audio samples. For example, if someone was to enter the text "metallic snare A#", the synth should be able to generate a tuned snare sample. To me this task seems more feasible and more useful than creating whole songs. There is already an abundance of labeled sample packs online that can be used for customizable training, generating samples removes the need to learn long term structure, and audio samples are much more useful for musicians compared to entire songs.',synthlm3:"At the moment, I've been going through older papers that MusicLM builds on such as AudioLM, SoundStream, and BERT. Recently, Meta also released their own audio generation model called AudioCraft, which may be a promising option given that its open-source and would require less training than MusicLM's multi-model, hierarchical structure. I'm hoping to get a somewhat usable model trained this summer and am looking forward to seeing the results!",dslabs1:"DSLabs was a semester long project that I completed while taking Cornell's CS5414 (Distributed Computing) with Lorenzo Alvisi. This class was easily one of the most challenging, rewarding, and well put together courses I have ever taken. The project itself consisted of a framework that allows students to create, test, and debug distributed systems, and four major labs where we were tasked with implementing and checking distributed systems similar in functionality to Google's Spanner.",dslabs2:'Lab 1 involved implementing an "at-most-once" key-value store (duplicate commands will only execute once), along with a basic client and server. Lab2 consisted of adding primary-backup replication to lab 1 using an all knowing view service that decides on primary backup configurations. This allows for state replication and therefore consistency, but it also leaves us with a single point of failure. ',dslabs3:"Lab 3 fixes this issue using Paxos. Paxos is an amazing algorithm that allows a group of servers to be fault tolerant as long as f <= (n-1)/2. It also guarantees that consensus can be reached during periods of synchrony. This part involved a bit too many hours of grinding in order to debug the system, but I'm proud to say that we eventually passed all of the test cases.",dslabs4:"Lab 4 added on multi-key transactions and sharding. This allows the system to process operations in parallel thus increasing performance proportional to the number of server groups. We also had to implement two phase commit for agreement between server groups during transactions. On its own 2PC is susceptible to failures, but when paired with paxos provides agreement without major availability issues.",sae1:"After working for Professor Sungyoung Kim at RIT for over a year starting in 2020, I was rehired as a part-time developer during my last semester of undergrad. During this semester, my task was to write a program that would allow Dr. Kim to collect data on how listeners interpret the spatial characteristics of audio. This was quite an enjoyable project because I was given a general overview of what to build, but every aspect of design and implementation was left up to me.",sae2:"The main feature of this program was an interactive 3D visual that is supposed to represent audio and its spacial characteristics. Users will hear a series of songs, and then adjust a set of four attribute sliders (width, depth, immersion, and clarity) to morph the 3D visual until it best describes each song. Users can also use their mouse to adjust the camera's perspective of the 3D visual.",sae3:"Given that this project was supposed to be a website, I decided to use Angular just to get some more experience with it. I really like Angular + Typescript because of the OOP style, and because it helps me keep my projects organized. As for the 3D visual, I used a well-known library called three.js. This was easily the most challenging part of the project since it was my first time doing anything related to computer graphics, but I learned a lot! I created a custom shader in order to have an animation that changed based on the music's volume and the attribute sliders. ",sae4:"For the overall structure of the software, I added my basic components such as the attribute sliders, a view component to hold the three.js canvas, a singular audio service that controlled everything sound related and could injected into any component, and a singular session values service, that was used to maintain important values during a instance of the program (such as the current round number, whether light or dark mode is on). This service was injected into the slider components and the view component, so both the sliders and the 3D graphic could have realtime access to the values of the attribute sliders.",ipt1:"This project was created during my internship in 2020 with Professor Sungyoung Kim. In collaboration with a team from University of Iowa, we were attempting to evaluate the effectiveness of hearing devices called hybrid cochlear implants. The team was also interested in people's ability to understand speech depending on background noise level. In short, I was given the task of independently creating a website that would allow the researchers to test participants hearing abilities and collect data. This ended up being a great project because it was the largest project I had ever worked on, I got to learn about web development, and the team successfully published research using the data collected from trials done with the software. Its a good feeling when the software you make is used for something important.",ipt2:"The website contains 5 unique testing modules. The Inharmonicity Training and Speech-In-Noise tests have 2 and 3 difficulty levels respectively. All tests heavily use the Javascript Web Audio API to generate and process sound at various frequencies and levels. The website is connected to a backend SQL database to store data for each user.",ipt3:'The main focus of the program was the Inharmonicity Training. In this module, users are presented with a box that produces a tone as their mouse hovers over it. The tone changes depending on the location of the mouse within the box. This tone consists of a group of low frequency oscillators and a group of high frequency oscillators set at precise frequency ratios. The goal is for the user to move their mouse inside the box until the tone sounds most "harmonic". After selecting a point, a gradient appears on the box that shows the user how correct their guess was. This is calculated based on the randomized frequency ranges of the box set before each trial.',portfolio1:"This Website! During quarantine I wanted to give React a try, so I started with a tutorial I found online and made some changes to it. I recently did a re-design as well.
