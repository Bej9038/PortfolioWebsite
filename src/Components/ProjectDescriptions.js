        synthlm1: "Given the impressive modeling capabilities of modern diffusion and flow-based models in the speech and music domains, " +
            "it seems clear to me that there will be some form of natural langauge tool available for music composers in the future. " +
            "Unfortunately, audio generation models are not suitable for music composition in their current state. " +
            "Some of these models may be able to generate full songs, but none are able to generate high-quality, individual samples well. " +
            "This fact highlights both a large data bottleneck as well as a lack of focus on this task by the community.",

        synthlm2: "The open source model that first peaked my interest was MusicGen from Meta AI in 2023. This is an " +
            "autoregressive transformer model that aims to predict time-steps in a discretized, compressed audio sequence conditioned on text. " +
            "Although these models were a huge step up in open source at the time and implement an interesting approach to audio modeling, " +
            "the limitations of autoregressive models become apparent when playing around with the model (consistency issues and slow generative speeds for long sequences). " +
            "This doesn't mean autoregressive models are inherently bad, I just think that maybe they are the best fit for the audio generation task. " +
            "Some other issues like artifact-free latent audio encoding and decoding were not completely solved at this point, lowering the quality of the model further. " +
            "Encodec (the model used in AudioGen) is solid, but not yet at the level needed for professional audio.",

        synthlm3: "By the end of the year (Dec 2023), I began experimenting with finetuning MusicGen with somewhat limited results. " +
            "Through testing I determined that the autoencoder Descript Audio Codec (DAC) had superior audio quality so I swapped out Encodec with DAC for these experiments. " +
            "Although DAC was an improvement on Encodec, I was still experiencing issues with model efficiency (AudioGen is a 7B model), dataset quality and breadth, and sequence consistency. " +
            "In June 2024, StabilityAI released Stable Audio Open (SAO). SAO is a 1B diffusion model that operates on a continuous latent space provided by a newer encoder model called Oobleck. " +
            "To me, SAO is superior to AudioGen in consistency, quality, simplicity, and efficiency. Diffusion/flow models are the clear winner for audio generation.",

        synthlm4: "However, the data bottleneck for this task still remains. " +
            "To fix this, I have been working on a dataset that is currently sitting at around 2TB. " +
            "The largest portion of this data came from a program I made to automate the data gathering and labeling process. I used LLMs " +
            "Gemini 2.5 Flash (API) and Qwen3-30B (Local) to generate captions given metadata of an audio sample. Each datapoint has metadata and conditioning fields " +
            "prepared in a predefined schema and saved as a json file. This dataset format was inspired by the dataset classes in " +
            "<a href='https://github.com/facebookresearch/audiocraft' target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer'>Meta's AudioCraft codebase</a>. " +
            "The rest of the data is either open source or manually labeled. When I get a chane, I am hoping to finetune a multimodal LLM to do labelling from raw audio as well. " +
            "This is pending completion of the metadata-caption dataset, so I have lots of training data to play around with. I used <a href='https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/model_doc/clap' target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer'>CLAP score</a> to filter all open source and synthetic data to ensure that data is high quality.",

        synthlm5: "On the engineering side, I created 4 main code packages: entropy_training, entropy_models, entropy_metrics, and entropy_data. " +
            "The model package was initialized from the model code in the <a href='https://github.com/Stability-AI/stable-audio-tools' target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer'>Stable Audio Tools</a> repo " +
            "(which surprisingly contained more bugs than I would have liked! A good lesson in testing your code and reviewing open source I guess) " +
            "and contains code for the DiT, autoencoder, and conditioning module. For text embeddings, I swapped out the original T5 used with SAO and added in " +
            "Qwen3 Embedding, CLIP, and CLAP for diverse text features. The data package holds the code for the audio dataset as well as " +
            "code for curating synthetic data and analyzing the dataset distribution. The training package contains controller/orchestrator code for training and evaluating the model, " +
            "and the metrics package has metrics for evaluation. Some interesting metrics I have been using are the model scores from <a href='https://ai.meta.com/research/publications/meta-audiobox-aesthetics-unified-automatic-quality-assessment-for-speech-music-and-sound/' target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer'>Meta's Audiobox Aesthetics</a>. " +
            "This is a pretrained model that predicts scores for an audio's content enjoyment, content quality, production complexity, and production quality. " +
            "These scores have actually been decent indicators of training progress and could potentially be useful for some experimental RL post-training. I also used CLAP score and personal judgement for evaluations.",

        synthlm6: "Initial/experimental training runs for the diffusion model were done on my local workstation with 1x5090. When I'm ready to scale " +
            "I will probably move to a multi-gpu setup on RunPod (and use up some free startup credits I have there). To speed up training, I used PyTorch's automatic mixed precision " +
            "to convert the original float32 SAO weights down to bfloat16. Bfloat16 was prefered over float16 as it is just a simple precision/mantissa truncation and no re-scaling is required. " +
            "I also preencoded the audio latents ahead of time in my dataset as the CNN was a bottleneck during the training step. For training/experiment tracking I used wandb.",


        synthlm7: "I created a <a href='https://github.com/EntropyAudio/entropy_frontend' target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer'>frontend with Angular</a> " +
            "as well as a small serverless backend + model inference function. For those backend pieces I used AWS Lambdas+S3+DDB and RunPod Serverless Endpoints respectively. My goal with the frontend was to make something " +
            "that felt like a hybrid between digital synth and LLM UIs, and also to make a UI that allows for natural preference data selection (aka a data flywheel). " +
            "RunPod/Lambda code can be found here: Note that the core packages like entropy_training are private.",

        //     " lab 1 using an all-knowing view service server that decides on primary backup configurations. This allows for state replication and consistency, " +
        //     "but it also leaves us with a single point of failure (the view service).",

        //     "also guarantees that consensus can be reached during periods of synchrony. This part involved a bit too many hours " +
        //     "of grinding in order to debug the system, but I'm proud to say that we passed all of the test cases.",
        // dslabs4: "Lab 4 added on multi-key transactions and sharding. This allows the system to process operations " +
        //     "in parallel thus increasing performance proportional to the number of server groups. We also had to implement two" +
        //     " phase commit for agreement between server groups during transactions. On its own 2PC is susceptible to failures, " +

        //     "easily the most challenging part of the project since it was my first time doing anything related to " +
        //     "graphics, but I learned a lot! I created a custom shader that morphs based on the music's volume and attribute slider values. ",
        // sae4: "For the design of the software, I added UI components such as the attribute sliders and menus, " +
        //     "a view component to hold the three.js canvas, a singular audio service that controls everything sound related " +

        //     "important values during each instance of the program (such as the current round number or username). " +
        //     "This service was injected into the slider components and the view component, so both the sliders and the 3D graphic could " +
